Few Miles:


- Agent : C/C++ (cross platform dependency)

    - it will provide Resource/Machine Info like Hostname, IP, Interfaces, etc.
    - netstat to collect the ports info and process consuming that port.
    - Agent can make http calls to Safe_Ports Server.
    - Agent can make http calls to analytics
    - Further operations.

- Linux Server : Python/SQL/Kafka (Safe_Ports)

    - Agent we can download. Later move that to machine/Resource and install it.
    - Use HTTP Long poll for connection between Safe_Ports server and Resource/Machine.
    - Provide an entry point for Analytics.
    - Baseline for UI Development.
    - Initiate and simulate micro-segmentation.

- UI Server: Javascript/Angular/D3js

    - Primarily mostly analytics.
    - Anomalies, threats, risk clear visibility.
    - Complete Visibility of machines installed.
    - Simulation of segmenation.
    - Min step segmentation.

- Analytics Server: Python/Casandra/Postgresql/Sparx
    
    - Feed is Linux Server(Safe_ports);
    - Must be able to predict and suggest segmentation.
    - Must be able to clearly visualise the threat associates with any machine.
    - Data feed TBD.
